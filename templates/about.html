          <p> I am Nadia Ramirez, a 17 year old from Chicago. One of my passions is health and fitness.
            I discovered my love for fitness the summer after freshman year. The beginning of my fitness journey started with the goal of losing weight.
            I never worried about how much I ate, what I ate, and when I ate until freshman year. I started calling myself names saying I was ugly or fat to my friends as a joke but little did I know that I was just putting myself down.
            My little cousin started calling me fat. I know you may be thinking, why would I allow a little kids words hurt me.
            Honestly I am not sure I guess I felt that since little kids have no filter and say things the way they are that he must have been telling the truth. Every time he called me fat it hurt.
            Summer after freshman year I became obsessed with working out everyday. I quickly gained an unhealthy relationship with food and myself...

            soo, Lets start on how to pronounce it ,( Gi-Zum-Ba)... you did it!!! I would’ve corrected you if you said it wrong anyway.
            I would have just told you to call me G.G ;) I was born in Côte d'Ivoire but i consider myself a Liberian.
            A story I would love to share is the first time I got a "boyfriend".
            It was not real and he definitely did not like me he just felt bad I guess.
            I am telling you this story to tell you what I did wrong. He asked me to....</p>

          <p>Hello! I'm Shannon Guider and I like in the west Chicago area. I want to share the resposibilites of how having a first crush is monumental for a girl. It’s a rite of passage to her first heart break.
             I liked everything about him. Neglecting the fact that we never said a word to each other but
             the glances, oh the connection was there.
             I couldn’t have possibly made up how I look up from my desk , he would just conveniently look up too.
             He was fine but he didn’t know he was fine. Perfect.
             That was enough for me to build up the courage to finally...</p>
